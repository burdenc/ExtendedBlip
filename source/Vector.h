// Vector.h -- specification of the Vector abstract data type
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdexcept>

/* The Vector we do as our C-language case study is limited to simulating
 * an array of integers (type int32_t). When we redo this data structure
 * in C++, we'll make a more useful Vector that can simulate an array of 
 * of anything. Also, as we're limited to C, this data structure will be
 * somewhat clunky to use, again, we'll fix that when we have the C++ tools
 *
 *
 * A Vector is always implemented using a dynamically allocated array
 * in practice, the abstract data type (i.e., the "class") for Vector is
 * just an interface wrapper around dynamically allocated arrays. The 
 * "improved" interface we provide includes
 *
 * 1. Bounds checking (no more buffer overlows creeping into production code)
 * 2. Adjustable size -- we can increase or decrease the size by adding or
 *    removing elements at the end of the array.
 *
 * In C, there are some stiff penalties (that clunkiness I talked about) to pay
 * to get these features. Most notably, it becomes incumbant upon our clients
 * (anyone who writes code using our Vector) to ensure that Vectors are always
 * properly initialized and always properly destroyed.
 *
 * The list of functions below is undoubtedly incomplete for a real-world
 * abstract data type. However, it is sufficient to do some basic ops on
 * Vectors. Recall that the "implied contract" states that client code will
 * NOT access the components inside the Vector struct (ever). Therefore 
 * anything that a client programmer might want to do must be provided by
 * the functions below
 */

/* T is a "type placeholder" 
 * in order to use the Vector, we simply tell the compiler what we want 
 * T to be (e.g., "int" or "Customer") and the compiler replaces T 
 * everywhere with that type and then compiles it. 
 * 
 * Using a template means we don't have to make a new Vector implementation 
 * for each possible way that our clients want to use the Vector
